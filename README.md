# magic_spysii_extra

This is a public repo that will contain the resources used for the software school of 2024. 

We will probably use it for other things in the future... But be aware **it is public**!

You may find a list of previous presentations in MAGIC meetings as well as useful papers in the [Resources](/Resources) folder
