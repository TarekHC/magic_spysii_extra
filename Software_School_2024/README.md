Lessons summary
===============

Lesson 0
--------

Meant as first contact, to check if people were prepared to follow the school. Few [slides were presented](20241009_lesson0_introduction.pdf). We quickly reviewed what an intensity interferometry analysis essentially means, and the different kinds of data you may find in the archive. People were reminded

Lesson 1
--------

Will focus on the first step of the analysis: handling raw interferometry data. Mainly it will cover:

* Understanding `magic_spysii` data structure.
* Understanding the content of raw interferometry data.
* Learn how to check the content of a raw file.
* Learn how to synchronize data, copying raw files and camera reports to your $MAGICSIIDATA folder.
* Learn how to reduce raw data.
